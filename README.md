### Overview 

This project makes use of the StatsBomb event and 360 data sources for the men’s UEFA Euro 2020 competition which includes 51 matches (data accessed via the StatsBombR package, following data manipulation and visualization code provided [here](https://statsbomb.com/news/statsbomb-announce-the-release-of-free-statsbomb-360-data-euro-2020-available-now/)).
The data has been prepared in order to facilitate analysis of various metrics over the course of regular gameplay. These metrics include duration and count of in-possession events, spatial positioning, and the number of opponents within the 360 freeze-frame (as a pseudo-measure for opponent pressure). These features are meant to serve as an example of the types of metrics that could be aggregated over the course of the game for analytics purposes, leveraging the StatsBomb dataset.
